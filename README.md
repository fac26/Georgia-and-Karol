# Karol and Georgia's Agency Website README

---

## FAC26 Markup Project

### Task Overview

Our challenge was to build an agency website as a team.

The website should give potential clients:

- An introduction to your agency
- Information about each member of your team
- A way to get in touch if they are interested in working with you

---

### Acceptance Criteria

To reach our user stories goals, we'll need to achieve these requirements:


- Navigation menu
- ‘About us’ section
- Contact form
    - A user cannot submit a form without filling out all of the mandatory fields (name, company name, email address)
    - Information from the form doesn’t get submitted until the user clicks a button

---

### User Stories

The potential clients will want to:

- See information about each member of your team so that I can know who you are
- Browse your website on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Click to navigate to different sections of your webpage
- Contact you to enquire about working with you
- Visit your website at a publicly accessible domain name

Additionally, as a visually impaired user, I want to:

- Navigate your website using keyboard controls
- Hear my screen reader describe the content on your website

---

### Implementation

We have split the work between us, working simultaneously through the user stories and created issues relating to these to assist our workflow.
